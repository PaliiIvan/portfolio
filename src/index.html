          React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
          Design simple views for each state in your application,

          Build encapsulated components that manage their own state,
          then compose them to make complex UIs.
          It saves time for developers as they don’t have to write various codes
          for the same features. Furthermore, if any changes are made in any particular part,
          it will not affect other parts of the application.

          React, compared to other popular frontend frameworks like Angular & Vue, is much easier to learn.

      Redux is simply a store to store the state of the variables in your app.
      Redux creates a process and procedures to interact with the store so that
      components will not just update or read the store randomly.
      Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

      It helps you write applications that behave consistently,
      run in different environments (client, server, and native),
      and are easy to test. On top of that, it provides a great developer experience,
      such as live code editing combined with a time traveling debugger.

    <div class="paragraph-description">
      Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
      The newer syntax, "SCSS", uses block formatting like that of CSS.
      CSS3 consists of a series of selectors and pseudo-selectors that group rules that apply to them.
      Sass extends CSS by providing several mechanisms available in more traditional programming languages,
      particularly object-oriented languages, but that are not available to CSS3 itself. When SassScript is interpreted,
      it creates blocks of CSS rules for various selectors as defined by the Sass file. The Sass interpreter
      translates SassScript into CSS. Alternatively, Sass can monitor the .scss file and translate it to an output .css
      file whenever the .sass or .scss file is saved.

      Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of
      making web pages presentable.

      CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of
      fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are
      used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other
      effects.

      CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
      Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.

          <p>Easy maintenance</p>
          <div>
            To make a global change, simply change the style, and all elements in all the web pages will be updated
            automatically.
            Now HTML attributes are being deprecated and it is being recommended to use CSS. So its a good idea to start
            using CSS in all the HTML pages to make them compatible to future browsers.

            CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in
            comparison to HTML attributes.
            Style sheets allow content to be optimized for more than one type of device. By using the same HTML
            document, different versions of a website can be presented for handheld devices such as PDAs and cell phones
            or for printing.

      Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and
      executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js
      lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts
      server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently,
      Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single
      programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

    <div class="paragraph-description">
      JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages ​​in the world.
      It is used to create interactive web pages, mobile applications, in server development.
      JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
      It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
      It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
      It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
      standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

          JavaScript is a dynamic scripting language supporting prototype based object construction.
          The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both Java and C++ to reduce the number of new
          concepts required to learn the language.JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented
          language.
          Objects are created programmatically in JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties
          to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic class definitions common
          in compiled languages like C++ and Java.

        <p>Client Side</p>
        <div>
          Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language.
          The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the
          browser.
          The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts.
          For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form
          field.
          The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid,
          they would be submitted to the Web Server.
          JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation,
          and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.

        <div>
          Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8
          engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network
          applications. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
          scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the
          user's web browser.
